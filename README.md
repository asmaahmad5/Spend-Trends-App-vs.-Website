Spend-Trends APP vs Website

Project Objective:
This project helps an e-commerce company decide whether to focus resources on improving their mobile app experience or their desktop website. Using a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kolawale/focusing-on-mobile-app-or-website), I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and built a predictive model to identify key factors influencing customer spending.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset includes information about e-commerce customers, including:

-Avg. Session Length: Average duration of in-store style advice sessions.
-Time on App: Average time spent on the mobile app (in minutes).
-Time on Website: Average time spent on the website (in minutes).
-Length of Membership: Number of years the customer has been a member.

Key Insights:

Length of Membership is the strongest predictor
-Customers who have been members for longer tend to spend significantly more.
-Retaining customers for extended periods drives revenue growth.

Mobile App Engagement Has a Stronger Impact on Spending
-Time spent on the app has a significant positive influence on customer spending.
-Time spent on the website shows little to no correlation with spending.
-This suggests that customers are more likely to make purchases through the app rather than the website.

Session Length and Customer Engagement 
-Longer session durations correlate with higher spending, indicating that engaged customers are more likely to make a purchase.

Strategic Buissness Implications:

1. Prioritize Mobile App Development- the app has a direct impact on spending, investing in user experience, personalization, and seamless checkout features could 
   maximize revenue.

2. Customer Retention is Key- Given that length of membership is the strongest predictor, implementing loyalty programs, exclusive perks, and personalized incentives could 
   drive long-term revenue growth.

3. Rethink Website Strategy- website has little correlation with spending, it may be better suited for customer discovery and engagement rather than direct 
   purchases.

Conclusion:
The analysis highlights the importance of leveraging the strengths of the mobile app while addressing the shortcomings of the desktop website. These insights provide a foundation for making informed, data-driven decisions about resource allocation.

Next Steps
-Conduct a deeper analysis of customer behavior on the app and website.
-Perform A/B testing to evaluate the impact of specific improvements to the app and website.
-Explore marketing strategies to enhance customer retention and length of membership.
