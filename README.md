Spend-Trends APP vs Website

Project Objective
This project aims to help an e-commerce company decide whether to focus their resources on improving their mobile app experience or their desktop website. Using a dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kolawale/focusing-on-mobile-app-or-website), exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a predictive model was used to identify key factors influencing customer spending.

Dataset Overview
The dataset includes information about e-commerce customers, including:

Avg. Session Length: Average duration of in-store style advice sessions.
Time on App: Average time spent on the mobile app (in minutes).
Time on Website: Average time spent on the website (in minutes).
Length of Membership: Number of years the customer has been a member.

Key Insights
Length of Membership:
The strongest predictor of annual spending, indicating that longer memberships correlate with higher customer spending.
Time on App vs. Time on Website:
Time spent on the app shows a modest positive correlation with yearly spending.
Time spent on the website does not significantly correlate with customer spending.

Strategic Implications:
The company may consider improving the desktop website to better engage customers and increase spending.
Alternatively, resources could be directed toward enhancing the mobile app, which already shows a stronger influence on customer spending.

Conclusion
The analysis highlights the importance of leveraging the strengths of the mobile app while addressing the shortcomings of the desktop website. These insights provide a foundation for making informed, data-driven decisions about resource allocation.

Next Steps
Conduct a deeper analysis of customer behavior on the app and website.
Perform A/B testing to evaluate the impact of specific improvements to the app and website.
Explore marketing strategies to enhance customer retention and length of membership.
